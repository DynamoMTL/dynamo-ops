A stand-up is a quick (often daily) check-in that usually lasts about 15 minutes. At this time, members on a project team share what they have accomplished the previous day, what they plan on accomplishing that day, and when it is the case, what are the blockers that interfere with their progress. 

For some maintenance projects, we can automate the stand up with a Slack bot so that everyone gets the same update as an in person stand-up, but asynchronous, on Slack. 

Ultimately, stand-ups, no matter their format, should be an efficient way to offer a pulse check on the project to the project manager and the rest of the team.
