To communicate with our clients, we essentially use Slack and Basecamp.

[Basecamp](http://www.basecamp.com) is a space that allows us to get clients feature requests, share files easily and basically have threaded discussions.

On the other hand, we can offer a [Slack](http://www.slack.com) channel to provide a real time and transparent feedback to our clients. Slack is not the place to ask features, but is instead the place to alert about an emergency or ask concices questions.

In order to follow the advancement of our work, we invite our clients to our [Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com/) instance. Projects are managed by using the Scrum methodology, and this tool allows us to prioritize features, have insights on current challenges and be fully transparent.
