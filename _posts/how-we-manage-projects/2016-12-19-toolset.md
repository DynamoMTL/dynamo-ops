Projects at Dynamo use, but are not limited to, the following tools:

<!-- more -->

## Basecamp

Our main project management app; this is where we keep all communication via message threads, to-do lists and files.

## Slack

Our instant messaging tool, Slack is quick conversations to either clarify a point, answer an easy question or raise an urgent concern. We use Slack for both instantaneous and asynchronous communication. 

## Github

The repository where we keep our code.

## Pivotal Tracker

A Scrum management tool, we use Pivotal Tracker to create and point stories, establish our sprints and provide on overview of the project’s progress.

## Blossom

A KanBan management tool, we use Blossom to prioritize feature cards, prioritize them and provide on overview of the project’s progress.
