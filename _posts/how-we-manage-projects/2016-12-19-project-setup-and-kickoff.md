Here are some steps to complete whenever we set up and kick off a new project :

## Housekeeping 

1. Invite the client team to the chosen project management tool (either Basecamp, Blossom, Github, etc.) 

2. Set up the Slack channels (internal and client facing) and invite the client team and key stakeholders. 

3. Schedule the weekly or bi-weekly client presentations and meetings. Invite the necessary team members and stakeholders. 

4. Schedule daily stand ups. 

5. Schedule bi-weekly iteration planning meetings. 

6. Schedule the retrospective meetings, to be completed once a sprint is complete. 

7. Have the team start the GitHub repository. 

8. Develop a deployment/code review/QA process with the development team. 


## Kick-Off

Depending on the nature of the project, the first big step will be to organize either a Design Sprint, a user story session or any other type of project kick-off session including the client team. The goal of this session is to obtain a macro view of the project objectives and all the design/functionality elements that will need to be taken into consideration when actually starting on the project. Taking notes during this session will be crucial, as it will inform the rest of the project as well as the final product. Oftentimes, we find it handy to refer back to these notes at key milestones in the project to ensure weâ€™re staying on track.
