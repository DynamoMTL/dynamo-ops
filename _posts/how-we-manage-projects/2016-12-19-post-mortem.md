Post-mortems, which are also referred to as debriefs, are an integral part of the lifecycle of any given project.

They help us uncover insights and serve as a pressure release valve so that the team can share what went well and what theyâ€™d hope to improve the next time. This helps us improve our internal processes, streamline workflows and find ways to increase overall team and client satisfaction on future projects. 

Following a launch or the deployment of a large feature, we typically hold these meetings, and the following:

* What went right during the project that we can repeat in the future?

* What went wrong during the project that we should avoid in the future?

* What should we do differently next time

By taking the time to self-evaluate and reflect on the outcomes of recent projects, our team is in a better position to ensure that these issues or inefficiencies are not repeated in the future. They also encourage a free-flowing dialogue that stimulates our team to raise flags and improve their daily workflow.
