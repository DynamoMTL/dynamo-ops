An iteration planning session happens at the eve of every sprint or other iteration period. 

<!-- more -->

This planning session allows the project group to get together, organize their workflow, delegate tasks and define a realistic scope for the iteration. The team agrees on a set of user stories that will make up the scope, and can be defined as the iteration goal. At the end of the session, the team collectively commits to the scope and agrees to deliver it by the end of the sprint.
