As part of the Agile methodology, we hold a retrospective at the end of every sprint in order to discuss how it went. The development team are each asked the following questions:

<!-- more -->

* What went well?

* What could be improved?

* What change can we make to improve the next sprint?

During retrospectives, we also take some time to review the cards or stories planned for the next sprint to insure that we are continuously working on the highest value features.
