#Kickoff
Kickoffs are a minimum 2-days process, but can be longer depending on the clients. We gather arount the clients with the whole project team (product manager, designer, frontend developer, backend developer and a facilitator)

# Day 1
The goal of the first day is to gain an understanding of the client's business as well as the goals all of the stakeholders have for the project.

##Understand The Client Business

##Goals for the project

##Map (and target)

# Day 2
The goal of the second day is to generate ideas for achieving
the goals we identified on the first day — essentially
building the foundation for the site’s product plan.

##Lightning demos

##Sketch

* crazy's,
