*Welcome to the Dynamo team!*

*We’re  thrilled to have you on board. In this package, you’ll find a few tokens of our appreciation: some Dynamo swag, a little taste of Canada, and a great microphone/speaker you can use for our regular video calls.*

*Working together will be a highly collaborative process. Throughout the project, your primary point of contact will be (blank), your Project Manager.  We’re really excited to get started on this project on (start date) with a (2 day kickoff/ design sprint). (Your PM) will send you the agenda shortly.*

*If we haven’t overwhelmed you with all things Dynamo, we’d encourage you to check out our blog ("Monday" on Medium) or our podcast (“Workmode” on iTunes), to learn more about our work, our advice for startups, and our interviews with leading creators about how they get their work done. If you’re around Montreal next month, we’d also be thrilled if you could join us for our Dynamic/MTL conference on November 29 - this is one of a series of quarterly events that we organize for Montreal's creative community featuring top guest speakers from around the world. Simply let me know if you’d like to attend and I’ll make sure tickets are waiting under your name.*

*I’ll be checking in periodically to see how the project is going, and I’d encourage you to reach out to (PM), Alex or me with any questions, feedback, or concerns at any point in time. We’re here for you. Looking forward to getting to know you better over the next few months and beyond!*
