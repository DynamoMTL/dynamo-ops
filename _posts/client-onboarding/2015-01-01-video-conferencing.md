This section should serve as a guide to to clients and Dynamo employees regarding video call best practices.

<!-- more -->

Since Dynamo’s home base is in Montreal, and we work with several remote team members and have clients all over the globe, one of the most common formats for both our internal and client-facing meetings is video-conferencing.

## Jabra
In our client onboarding package, we always send a Jabra, our favourite two-in-one handy microphone/speaker. We highly recommend using this in video calls where there are more than one people participating. There is no software required to operate the Jabra, all you need to do is plug it into a USB port on your computer and select the Jabra as an external source for your audio input and output.

## Headphones
If you are the only participant, the built-in microphone on your computer should be fine. To reduce echo, we highly recommend using a headset instead of relying on your computer’s speakers.

Our two preferred platforms, and best practices for setting up video conferences are below:

## Google Hangouts
Unless otherwise specified, we use Google Hangouts as the default video conferencing platform. The recommended browser is Chrome. In the calendar event you have been invited to, you will see a green video icon with the words "Join Meeting". Simply click on the “Join Meeting” link to enter the Hangout. If this is your first time using this platform, you may be prompted to download a plugin.

## Highfive
If the person running the meeting sends you a link to a Highfive video conference, you simply need to click the link to join the meeting and choose the option to allow access to microphone and camera. If you will be using Highfive regularly, you can download the desktop app for simplicity.

## Uberconference
Either of the above For audio-only calls, we can connect via the good old fashioned telephone, or by Uberconference with the dial-in info below.
