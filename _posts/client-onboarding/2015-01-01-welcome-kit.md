Every new Dynamo client is sent a Welcome Kit upon receipt of their signed contract. Think of this as our small way of welcoming you to the Dynamo family.

<!-- more -->

The kit includes:

## Welcome Letter
This will give you some key insights about how we run our projects and who your main point of contact will be.

## Swag + Stickers
We won’t give away too much here, or it wouldn’t be a surprise.

## Dispatch Coffee
Coffee is a huge part of our culture at Dynamo, and we love to spread the love. Dispatch is our neighborhood coffee shop and roastery, and we think it’s the perfect pick-me-up for the mid-afternoon slump.

## Jabra
Jabra is our favourite two-in-one handy microphone/speaker. We highly recommend using this in video calls where there are more than one people participating. There is no software required to operate the Jabra, all you need to do is plug it into a USB port on your computer and select the Jabra as an external source for your audio input and output.
