Wondering how to request time off? 

<!-- more -->

## Vacation Requests

We’ve developed a nifty math-based calculation for everyone here to help them figure out how far in advance a vacation request should be made. The rule is you should ask as many weeks in advance as the number of days off you’re requesting. Example: if you’re requesting 4 days off, you need to request that at least 4 weeks prior.

Mais, pourquoi? Well, because we’re 30+ people with myriad projects happening, and we plan 3 months at a time.

## Holidays
Generally speaking, we’re closed for all the regular holidays (not as much as banks, but more than dépanneurs). When there are holidays that sort of spread over a few days (Easter, for example), everyone has the option to choose which day they prefer to take off. 

Around Christmas in particular, we usually close up shop for the week between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Day. We have found that this time is a wonderful time to take a break, recharge with loved ones and come back ready to rock new projects in the new year.
