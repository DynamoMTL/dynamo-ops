One of the Dynamo perks that you can take advantage of, if you so choose, is the Dynamo phone plan. The goal of the plan is to subsidize your personal cell phone bill so that you can avoid turning red with CellRage™ every month.

Here’s the deal: you allow Dynamo to deduct CAD $20.00 from your bi-weekly pay, and Dynamo pays Rogers a bunch of money on a monthly basis on behalf of all Dynamo employees who take part in the phone plan. Big savings, big-time win-win.

What do you get? Well, as of May 1, 2015, the mobile phone plan includes the following wireless services:

- Unlimited long-distance calling minutes to North American numbers;

- 5 GB of local data per month (Canada-wide);

- Unlimited Canada to Canada, U.S., International text, picture, video messaging;

- Call display with name display; 

- Visual voicemail; and

Flex US roaming options for voice, text, and data (note: this is an optional service that is provided by Rogers with additional fees).

What happens when you go over your personal allotment, or have roaming fees? Well, you  allow Dynamo to deduct any additional sums from your pay to account for these overages. Makes sense, no?

If you’re wondering if you have to sign a contract, the answer is yes, but with Dynamo, not Rogers. The reason being that Dynamo can cancel this contract with Rogers at any time and without any notice to you. Therefore, if you purchase a subsidized phone directly from Rogers, you are bound to whatever contract you have with them (and would owe them whatever money that contract states) in the event that Dynamo cancels its corporate contract.
