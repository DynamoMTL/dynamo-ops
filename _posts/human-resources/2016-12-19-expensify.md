To file an expense, please follow the following steps:

## Create expense

Once you have your account set up, the first step is to create an expense (choose the ‘expenses’ tab at the top, and select ‘new expense’). From here, you can upload all of your receipts (please include a photo of the original receipt – not just the transaction record). The system will ask you to categorize your expense and tag it for tracking purposes. Please ensure the tag and category fields are filled out in order to simplify the process and avoid delays in getting paid back cash money.

## Add your expenses to a report

Once you have uploaded all of your expenses, select all of the expenses that you would like to include in a particular report. On the left hand side, a ‘new report’ button will appear. This will prompt you to name your report. 

## Submit your report for approval

Please make sure to double check all of your details and verify that the correct receipts have been attached before hitting the ‘submit’ button. Your expense will be reviewed, and paid back within a few weeks.
