The Dynamo Profit Sharing Plan – otherwise known as we’re all in this together. 

<!-- more -->

We believe in paying it forward, taking care of each other and rejoicing together in success. Therefore, we introduced the a profit sharing plan in 2014 for all employees and it’s been a lot of fun (read: dolla-dolla bills) so far! 

Every year, after our books are closed, we appoint a portion of pre-tax profit to the Dynamo Profit Sharing Plan and then divide that amount by the total number of shares issued. The number of shares issued changes every year and is at the discretion of ownership to modify. In short, one day of employment at Dynamo equals one Dynamo Share. Therefore, depending on how long you have been an employee of Dynamo, you are given a salary bonus matching the cumulative value of your shares. 

Shares don’t carry any voting rights, are usually paid out late summer and each employee can choose to receive their payout as a 100% salary bonus, 100% contribution to their VRSP, or a combination of the two.
