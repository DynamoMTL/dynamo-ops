Here’s our policy on sick days: If you’re sick, stay home. Why? Because:

<!-- more -->

- You need to get better;

- We don’t want to get worse;

-  We don’t have any chicken noodle soup at the office.

So, lie down, cuddle up with some tea, soup, kleenex and recuperate. Then, come back full of health and zest and tell us all about your binge Netflixing!
