Generally, the hiring process goes something like this: 

<!-- more -->

* We identify a need

* We create a role description

* We post this opening on various channels

* We interview candidates

* We finalize a list of the top candidates and check references

* We pick a candidate and extend an offer for a three-month contract

* We negotiate and sign a contractor agreement

* If all goes well, we extend an offer for full-time employment

* We sign said offer for full-time employment

* We rejoice!

It’s a lot of work, but it helps to contextualize how we’ve built such a tight-knit team. Here’s a bit more detail about how we communicate with prospective employees:

## Follow-up email

If a potential candidate is under consideration, we’ll reach out with an email that describes more about various perks and policies at Dynamo. We keep an email template doc on Drive to make sure we don’t miss anything

## Contractor or employee?

Until they (and we) are 100% sure, it’s ideal to sign a contractor agreement to start for a couple of months. Then once this arrangement is up and running, sign a real employee contract if both parties are happy.

## Job offer

When we’re ready to offer someone a job, we use a job offer letter. We have an official job offer template in the Job Offer Letters folder in Drive.

## Employee Contract

Once we come to an agreement in principle and we know we want to work together, we’ll draw up an Employee Contract.

* Find Master Template in the Drafts folder

* Duplicate it

* Change specifics (names, salary, dates)

* Send for Signature through Adobe Cloud Services (same process as client contracts)

## Contractors and freelancers

All freelancers/contractor should have a contract and should issue invoices. All interns should have a freelance contract as well.

## Creating a contractor agreement

* Find Template in the Drafts folder or re-use a similar contract example

* Duplicate it

* Change specifics (names, gender pronouns, salary, dates)

* Send for Signature through Adobe Cloud Services (same process as client contracts)

* Catalog the signed contract in Drive

Typically the contractor agreement is for a specified amount of time (3, 6 or 12 months) and then extended or re-negotiated when it comes to an end.

## Extensions

For contractors on fixed-length contracts (and with whom we want to continue working), we’ll sign a contract extension when a given contract’s term is coming to an end. These are typically for three, six or twelve months.

## Invoices from contractors

Each agreement with a contractor should specify an invoicing schedule — all payments should be made against invoices; among other things, we may use these invoices as part of SRED filings. When a contractor send us invoices, it should be put in the appropriate folder in Drive and sent to Bookkeeping.

## Foreign workers

For foreign workers, there is an Temporary Work Permits/Visas folder to consult.

## Miscellaneous letters and attestations

For random letters/attestations (maternity/paternity leave, employment confirmation or mortgages/etc.), there is a Dynamo Letters folder in Drive.
