First, let’s be clear what we mean by "compensation." Most people equate compensation solely with salary. Compensation very obviously includes salary, but is made up of so much more here at Dynamo. We know that sounds like a whole lot of lip service, but let’s review what Dynamo means by “compensation.”

<!-- more -->

When we talk about compensation, either during recruitment or hiring, or during a review or check-in, we include all of the following:

- Annual salary

- Insurance benefits
 
- Profit sharing
 
- Life perks: lunch program, cell phone plan, etc
 
- Health & wellness perks: yoga, meditation, gym, etc
 
- Learning budget

The reason we include all of the above is because the sum of these points is how we actually compensate each of the team members. Annual Salary (point #1) is, of course, the biggest component of compensation and is often what people compare against themselves and amongst one another. However, when omitting points #2-#6, individuals don’t give themselves the full picture of what they are actually being paid on an annual basis. It’s important to realize both from an employee standpoint and leadership standpoint what everyone is actually making. Providing non-salary compensation is not a right, but it is a given within Dynamo.
