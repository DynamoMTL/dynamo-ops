The number one requested item by the team at Dynamo is more feedback. One of the key ways in which we respond to that desire is through regular Performance Reviews.

Much in the same way that we run our digital projects, our review process has changed as we iterate upon it, constantly striving for improvement.  As a result, this process has changed year after year, is in a constant state of evolution, and will surely be in the midst of some type of change again when you read this. However, as it stands today, our current process is pretty good and helps set everyone goals, touch base and forge ahead together. 

For a regular Performance Review, each employee meets with 2 members of the leadership team every six months. Within any 12 month period, they will have a complete annual review and a more informal check-in review. Let’s dissect those two a little so you can understand what they are and how they differ.

## Annual Review
For these, HR will ask for feedback from the entire company for the reviewee. The feedback requested comes in the form of Start, Stop, Continue (SSC). In other words, each member  of the team is asked to provide one thing that the reviewee should start doing, one thing that the reviewee should stop doing, and one thing that the reviewee should continue doing. HR will then amalgamate, summarize and generalize the feedback so as to anonymize it somewhat. Leadership will then provide their own SSC for the reviewee and HR will add that to the review document. Lastly, the reviewee is asked to provide their own SSC for themselves as well as SSC for leadership. HR then adds that to the review document as well. At the end of all this, we have a nice, easy to deliver and digest review document that encompasses feedback from peers, leadership and oneself. The review document is used, and delivered, by the leadership team that is presenting the review. The review is not a one way conversation and most end up becoming wonderful exchanges about career, life and the future. We usually wrap up each review with a look at compensation (including salary), how they’ve spent their Learning Budget, and then confirm the next review dates. Leadership and HR will then update the review document and post to our internal HR application (BambooHR) for reference

## Informal Six-Month Check-In
As the title suggests, these are more informal. HR is not really involved, other than to remind the reviewee that the check-in is approaching and they should prepare accordingly. To "prepare" for a check-in means you are respoonsible for reviewing your SSC from the annual review, measure oneself against set goals and provide feedback to leadership on how they’ve been doing lately. This can often take the form of a walk, or a chat over a coffee or a beer, and is meant to ensure we’re all on target for hitting our goals. There’s less stress (yes, performance reviews are stressful), more dialogue and often the reviewee ends up doing all the talking. Notes from these check-ins are written out by leadership and added to our internal HR application (BambooHR). 
 
As we move forward, more of the onus will be put on the reviewee to direct their reviews, to gather information and to ultimately have a much stronger say in shaping their futures. Leadership will be omnipresent, of course in doing what they need to do – providing guidance, encouragement (and reality checks), wisdom and high fives.
