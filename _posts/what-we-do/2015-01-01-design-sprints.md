A design sprint is a five-day methodology that we use to help answer critical business questions through strategic thinking, design, prototyping and testing.

Developed by our friends at GV (previously Google Ventures), the sprint allows key stakeholders, experts and the people building your product to get in the same room and spend focused time solving the single, most pressing question that your business faces.

Together, we'll decide what that question is and answer it together. Ultimately, this answer ends up influencing feature sets, prioritization, design direction and overall strategy surrounding a project, product or idea.

When clients come to us in the early stages of product development, we usually propose a sprint to help us prioritize the most important challenges in order to launch. By answering those big questions at the outset, we can be sure that we are building the right product, for the right people, the right way.

While we always adapt the sprint based on the time we have, a typical sprint has a prescribed format that looks something like this:

## Monday

On the first day of the sprint, we host a series of structured discussions to set the stage for the rest of the week. Together, we’ll align on a long-term goal, map out challenges and choose a focus for the week. By the end of the day, we pick an ambitious, yet manageable, problem that we can solve in one week.

## Tuesday

On Tuesday, we’ll start our day by sharing inspiration from existing ideas and finding ways to remix and rework them. In the afternoon, each person will sketch a variety of concepts by using a four-step process that emphasizes critical thinking over artistry.

## Wednesday

By Wednesday morning, your team will have a variety of solutions to choose from, so you’ll spend the morning critiquing ideas in order to decide which has the best chance of achieving your long-term goal. In the afternoon, you’ll create a storyboard and step-by-step plan for your prototype.

## Thursday

With your storyboard in hand, you’ll turn your concept into a prototype. By focusing on the customer-facing aspect(s) of your product or service,  you’ll be able to finish it in a single day. Part of the team will also prepare an interview script and recruit potential ‘users’ to test the product on Friday.

## Friday

Your sprint began with a big challenge and an energetic group of people. Now, you’ve created a promising solution, solved a real problem, and built a realistic prototype. Now, you’ll take it one step further by interviewing customers and record their reactions to your prototype. This test makes the entire sprint worthwhile and will help you figure out what to do next.

Ultimately, by the time you’ve completed the sprint, you should know whether you’ve set out to solve your most pressing business problem, will be armed with visual proof that it’s possible and your team will be invested and invigorated by the challenge.
