Whether our clients operate exclusively online or their website stands in complement to a bricks-and-mortar store, our mission is to weave technology, design and strategy to build beautiful, functional ecommerce experiences.

To design and build an ecommerce store, we employ the same five-phase methodology that we use to design and build digital products. Below is a rough outline of our approach:

1. If applicable, we’ll design the brand identity or work within the constraints of your existing brand to start work on the design of the website and digital experience

2. Our user experience designers will define the product by working closely with key stakeholders and new/existing users. This will help us assess core functionality, develop a roadmap and set milestones together.

3. In parallel, we will set up the ecommerce* platform and third-party integrations to manage inventory, fulfullment, shipping, returns, promotion, store credit, transcactions and transactional emails.

4. At this point, the site will begin to take shape. User research and wireframing will have laid the foundation for the visual design, and we’ll begin work on the front-end integration. The site will start to have real functionality, and will look and feel ‘real.’

5. We’ll set up convenient, easy-to-use analytics tools to keep track of traffic and conversions, and deploy the site after rigorous testing to ensure everything is working correctly.

Our prefered ecommerce platform is Solidus.  Built with Ruby on Rails, it is a mountable engine that provides a scalable, stable, and highly customizable platform for online stores. We also have experience building Shopify stores, but this platform does not provide as much flexibility as Solidus, and should be limited for smaller, simpler projects.
