User happiness is the ultimate metric of success on any digital platform. Our UX approach consists of  bringing the user's perspective forward during key moments of the design process, establishing the necessary empathy in order to surpass their expectations.

In order to keep the user's goals aligned with the product's, we aim to embed user research practices throughout our workflow. This process should be fully scalable, but a larger picture can be divided in four major phases happening in tandem so that the insights and conclusions from the previous can inform the next one:

## Research
Instead of making assumptions, we extract valid insights from key players right from the start. Among the deliverables we can find:

  * Design Sprint / Kickoff Meetings
  * User Flow
  * User and stakeholder interviews
  * Personas

## Materialize
We start getting a clearer, more substantial picture of the user journey at this point in order to bridge their expectations with what the product aims to achieve. We can now start to focus on the product's interface. Deliverables typically found on this phase include:

  * User Journey Map
  * User Stories
  * Content Strategy
  * Wireframes
  * Prototype

## Test
Once the barebones of the product interface are defined, an opportunity appears to measure the user's impressions and validate our work's alignment with them. This is a highly informative phase that will inform the upcoming design and engineering processes. Here we'll be taking care of:

  * Usability Testing Sessions
  * Usability Report

## Iterate
As we shift our focus to design/build sprints, an iterative approach to research should keep the team grounded to the user's perspective. This continuous cycle of feedback allows us to identify weak points and areas of improvement before launch. The tools and deliverables allowing us to achieve this include:

  * Heuristic Landscape (moodboards, visual references, legacy work)
  * Feature-basis Usability Testing
  * Metrics Assessment
  * Online Surveys
  * Customer Service Feedback
  * Technical Documentation (living design systems)

Good user experience is a matter of empathy. By pledging allegiance to the user and amplifying their voice we can bring valuable input to the whole team and be sure to create digital products that are not just usable, but also meaningful and delightful.
