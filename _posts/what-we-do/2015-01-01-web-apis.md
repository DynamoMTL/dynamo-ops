We create well-structured and detailed JSON APIs tailored to a businessâ€™s domain model, adhering to RESTful principles, easily integrated with any client application.

Web APIs are the backbone of our larger multi-platform applications. Having standard endpoints that contain a single source of truth helps to build a strong solution for our clients without duplicating the logic between a variety of applications.

API design is a foundational step in the development of large integrated projects that have multiple clients. In creating APIs, we consider the ease of use, security, flexibility and documentation. We do this iteratively, so both internal and client-side back-end developers all contribute to guarantee an easy, seamless integration.

The design is usually implemented first with a platform like Apiary. This allows developers to start work immediately while the back-end is being build which reduces total production time significantly.
