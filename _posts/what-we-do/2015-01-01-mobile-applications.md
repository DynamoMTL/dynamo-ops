We design and develop applications for both leading platforms: iOS and Android. The creation process is a collaborative endeavor between the designers and the developers to ensure a first-class user experience.

To do this, we use the same iterative approach that we use to design and build great digital products. Here’s how it works:

## Strategy & Research

We have found that business strategy and design research have significant overlap. We’ll use this phase of the project to better understand your business, brand, audience, constraints and internal expertise. We work alongside our clients to align on product strategy, business goals and market trends to set expectations and success metrics together.

## User Testing

Creating an app means turning insights from design and business into requirements for the product. We perform user research to create personas and archetypes, define feature sets and outline user flows to establish the steps a user will take to accomplish a variety of tasks at a high level.

## Product Definition

Once an initial direction for a product is established, the feature-set and flows are turned into preliminary mockups. We’ll create an iteration plan to define project phases, milestones, and risks. From there, we’ll create wireframes that are iterated upon based on input from key stakeholders, development and design teams, as well as users, until a predefined set of criteria are met.

## Design

In the design phase, we bring the skeletal wireframes to life. Through visual hierarchy, color, interaction, and typography, we lead users through tasks intuitively and add warmth to the experience. This phase also allows us to ensure consistency across a product or suite of products and aligns all UI elements into a functional, rational system.

## Execution & Development

With the framework of the application established, the requirements set and the visual design nearing completion, we move into the development phase to develop the product. Usually, this takes place concurrently with the final phase of visual design to ensure collaboration between development and design teams to bring the product to life – often iterating and experimenting along the way.

We specialize in native apps, but will work within the time and budgetary constraints necessary to build an app in the tech stack of your choice.

Since much of what we know at the outset of a project is likely to change, our process is built to embrace volatility through the use of short, focused iterations and regular, open communication.

We believe great products don’t happen by accident – they are built through the combination of strategic thinking, user research, interface design, and development.
