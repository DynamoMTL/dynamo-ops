Foosball is our favorite game at the office and we even have invited other agencies to compete with us.

It allows us to regenerate our batteries to get even more productive and more relaxed for the next hours. Along the years, it has played an important role in our team bonding.

##Allowed foosball time

* 12h until 13h
* 17h30

##Rules
* We invite the players to respect the other workers needing concentration by postponing their games;
* Last score cannot be made from the 5's;
* More than 1-clock spin is severely reprimanded;
* Be fair-play.
