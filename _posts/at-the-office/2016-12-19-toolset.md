We use a whole host of tools to keep our office running, but here’s a shortlist to get you acquainted with a few of our favorites:

## Kisi Locks
**Each team member will be granted access to the Kisi app. This will allow you unlock all doors at Dynamo HQ. Feels good to be powerful, eh? 

Doors that are setup with Kisi:

* Second Floor – Main Door

* Second Floor – Back Door

* Third Floor – Main Door

* Third Floor – Back Door

* Locker Room

* Server/Printer Room

Please note that the front door requires a physical key. 

## Google Calendar

Booking your meetings is primarily done through Google Calendars. It is important to assign a room to your meetings to assure the space is available to you. 

## Expensify

This is the program we use to track our expenses. If you would like to be reimbursed for a purchase, it is necessary to submit it through Expensify. For more details, please check Expensify. 

## Slack

We use Slack for just about *all *of our communication – asynchronous, instant, internal, external, client-facing, foosball-table-racing – whatever. Welcome to your new obsession.
