## House Guidelines

This is a collection of guidelines for the joint spaces of our office. It was built to help newcomers to the company.


### Building information

We are located at 6640 Avenue de l’Esplanade, we currently occupy both the 2nd and 3rd floor.
The front door is unlocked by the first person to arrive in the morning and relocked by the last one to leave in the evening.


Some tools you will need:

**Kisi:** Each team member will be granted access to the Kisi app. This will allow you unlock all doors at Dynamo HQ. Feels good to be powerful, eh?

**Keys:** You will be given a key to the front door (this door is not on the Kisi network) and a key that will open all the office doors (back up for Kisi or uncharged phones). 


### Common Spaces

**Conference Rooms:** Conference rooms are located on both the 2nd and 3rd floors. 

_Book your conference rooms._ Conference rooms must be booked in advance via Google Calendar (you can find the available options when booking an event on your calendar on the right hand side using the ‘rooms’ tab)

_Respect meeting times._ Please be sure to respect start and finish times of your meetings, as there are likely meetings before and after your own. 

_Keep the rooms tidy._ Glasses, cups, trash and scrap paper should be removed and all the tools put back to their labelled spot in the cabinet for the next user. 

**Kitchen/Cafe:**  Located on the 2nd floor, please feel free to book this space on Google Calendar for meetings/gatherings, just be sure that it is not during lunch hour (11:45-1). 

_Keep it Clean._ This is a shared space, please clean up after yourself. This means there should never be any cutlery, cups, or dish ware of any kind in the sink or on the countertops. If you spill something, wipe it, if you take out the milk, put it back, is the dishwasher full, start it! You get the idea! 

_Don’t highjack the fridge._ 1 fridge, many users. Please be sure to use what small fridge space we have with others in mind (ie: no big bags, bring home your leftovers). 
Recycle. Be sure to rinse out anything that you put in the recycling bin. Cans and bottles can be put on the shelf outside the 2nd floor back door to be returned. 

_Compost._ Any food, napkins, compostable containers can be put directly into the container under the sink, not sure if it’ compostable, ask Boris! 

**Phone Booths:**  There are five phone booths located on the 2nd floor.

The pods serve as a private workspace for us to use whenever needed. Whether for a quick phone call, or to dive into ‘deep work’ for the day, please feel free to use these spaces however you see fit. They do not need to be booked in advance. 

**Locker Room:**  The locker room is located on the 3rd floor facing the main entrance to the office space. You can access the Locker Room by using  Kisi, please note that this door is locked at all times. 

**Bike Room:**  Located in the basement the bike room is a locked space to store your bike. Please ask Sam if you need the code.

**Server Room:**  Located in the back stairwell on the 3rd floor. You can access the Server Room by using Kisi, please note that this door is locked at all times. 

Our main printer can be found in the Server Room, you can print remotely by connecting to ‘Hewlett-Packard HP Color LaserJet 2600n’. 

**Pets:**  Pets are definitely allowed in the office! Please be respectful of the space your pet is in as there are people in the office that are allergic or generally not interested in pet attention. If you happen to be leaving your animal alone, please make sure that it won’t be bothering others. 

Do not allow your pets to run around the office freely.

Animals are not allowed on couches or in conference rooms. 


### Shared Activities

**Quarterly 6640 Round Table:** These will take place on the last Thursday of March, June, September and December (Dec. subject to change with holiday schedule) from 4-5pm, this is a meeting for us to discuss building wide initiates and issues, followed by snacks and drinks.

**Wine/Beer O’Clocks:**  Taking place mostly on Fridays (but not limited to), we like to share a couple beverages and snacks together after the work day. 

**Yoga:**  Our weekly yoga class takes place on Thursdays from 9-10am, join the #namaste channel on Slack for more information. 

**Lunch and Learns:**  We love to share! Share new or old knowledge/information, personal goals, overviews of recent conferenced attended!
Some lunch ‘n learns may not merit a full lunch hour, so we’ve termed them “exhiBITS.” These are usually 10-15 minute presentations on a topic that doesn’t require deep introspection, but is worth bringing awareness to.

Be sure to email both teams to ensure full building participation! 

**Volunteer:**  Join us on second Monday of each month to volunteer at a soup kitchen. Join the #goodness channel for more information or if you have a volunteer initiative you’d like to share!

Don’t discount lunch, breaks, foosball, and any other chance we get, too! 


### Closing the Office

If you are the last one at the office, there are a few office closing tasks you need to do:

**Lights:** Please turn off all the lights on the 2nd and 3rd floors. This includes lights inside conference rooms, bathrooms and phonebooths. The lights for the the 3rd floor are located inside the locker room.

**Locks:** If leaving last it is your responsibility to assure the front door is locked.
