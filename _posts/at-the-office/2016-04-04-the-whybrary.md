## The Whybrary

Space to handle easily answered WHY questions. Such aaaazzzzz:
- Why do we call Guillaume 'Boris'?
  - Upon his hiring, he would have been the third Guillaume @ Dynamo. That's about 3 too many so we massaged his last name 'Bourrousse' into 'Boris' and that was that
- Why did we move from Old Montréal to Mile Ex?
  - More Space! Old Mtl is cramped, smells like old water and my high hells get wrecked on the cobblestone. 
- Why doesn't Braden just move to Montréal already? Gosh!
  - Nobody truly understands the answer to this question.
  - ...or ever will. That guy, basically the black sheep.
