Each member of the Dynamo team will be assigned a workspace on their first day.

Your workspace will include:

* desk (height adjustable);
* chair;
* monitor;
* keyboard;
* Mouse;
* desk lamp;
* storage drawers (coming soon).

This will be your personal unshared space at the office. Please try to keep your area tidy and clutter-free to allow our maintenance team to properly clean your desk.

*Note:* The desks arrangement in the office is subject to change, meaning your desk and equipment will follow you around, but the specific spot will change every 3 months.
