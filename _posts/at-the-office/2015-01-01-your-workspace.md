Each member of the Dynamo team will be assigned a workspace on their first day. Your workspace will include: 

<!-- more -->

* Desk (can be adjusted for standing);

* Chair;

* Monitor;

* Keyboard;

* Mouse;

* Desk lamp;

* Storage drawers

This will be your personal unshared space at the office. Please try to keep your area tidy and clutter-free to allow our maintenance team to properly clean your desk. 

Please note, the desks arrangement in the office is subject to change, meaning your desk and equipment will follow you around, but the specific spot will change every 3 months.
