There are five phone booths (also referred to as pods) located on the second floor. 

<!-- more -->

The pods serve as a private workspace for us to use whenever needed. Whether for a quick phone call, or to dive into ‘deep work’ for the day, please feel free to use these spaces however you see fit. 

Each pod is equipped with a Macbook charger and a headset for your convenience, but please leave them in their respective spot for the next user.
