Team meetings are the cornerstones of a well-organized project. Luckily, we have three beautiful conference rooms from which to choose.

## Equipment

Each room has a television that is equipped with both Highfive and AppleTV to ensure that meetings are not only productive for the people in the office, but also for our remote champions and outstanding clients. 

The rooms are also equipped with whiteboards. If something is written on them upon arriving, take a picture of it, and share it in our #whiteboard Slack channel to make sure that nothing important is lost.

## Etiquette

Meetings can be lengthy, and much has been written and debated about their efficacy and (in)efficiencies. At Dynamo, we have a few hard-and-fast rules for hosting and attending meetings. They are as follows: 

* If you are the organizer, please be sure there is a clear agenda and purpose for the meeting

* If you are the organizer, ask yourself: "does this need to be a meeting or can it be handled asynchronously on Slack?" 

* If you are the organizer, ask yourself who needs to be involved in this meeting. If there are a few people that you’d like to keep aware of the meeting, please be sure to mark their attendance as ‘optional.’

* If you are the organizer, please ensure that you arrive a few minutes early to set up any video-conferencing that may be required.

* If you are invited to the meeting and your presence is not listed as optional, please show up to the meeting on time and prepared. 

* If you are attending the meeting, please close your laptop and put away your phone. We prefer if you take notes with a pen and a paper so that everyone around the table can be fully engaged, and the meeting can start and end promptly. 

## Booking

Every meeting room has a corresponding Google Calendar for you to see its availability (search ‘other calendars’ to find each of the three conference rooms):
* 2nd Floor Conf. Room
* 3rd Floor Big Conference Room
* 3rd Floor Small Conference Room

It is critical when booking your meetings to assign a ‘room’ to your event should you wish to use a conference room. To do this, use the tab on the right of the ‘guests’ tab marked ‘rooms’ and only the available conference rooms will appear. Once selected, you will have that space officially booked for your selected time-slot.
