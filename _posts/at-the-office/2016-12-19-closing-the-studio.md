We are the only company in the building, but as this will probably change, we are getting into the habit of closing the doors behind us. 

<!-- more -->

Luckily, we use [Kisi](https://getkisi.com/), a nice mobile application that allows us to open and unlock doors seamlessly (like magic)!  Simply wave your phone in front of the Kisi sensor to unlock a door. Doors will remain open between 9 AM and 6 PM. 

Now, to tackle closing the studio, we have a multi-step process. Here’s our handy checklist: 

* Turn off the third floor lights (yes, even the conference rooms)

* Turn off the second floor lights (yes, even the conference room)

* Be nice! And make sure there are no dirty dishes in the sink before you leave. 

* You also need to close all the individual lights in the phone booths. That’s right – there are two light switches per booth.  

* Say goodbye to your colleagues (just kidding, you are the last one here and no one is listening), and lock up the door behind you. 

Closing up the studio is very important to ensure everyone’s personal belongings and work gear remains in tact.
