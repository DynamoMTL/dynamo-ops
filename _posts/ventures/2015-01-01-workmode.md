[Workmode](http://workmode.show/) is a series of conversations with leading creators on how they get their work done, hosted by Alex Nemeroff, Co-Founder of [Dynamo](http://godynamo.com/).

<!-- more -->

Exploring the realities of creative work, we chat with guests about how they got started, their process, what drives them, and what may still keep them up at night despite having achieved outward success. Through Alex’s avid curiosity and down-to-earth conversational style, listen to first-hand accounts that delve beneath the veneer of online personas to reveal human ambitions and struggles.

Our podcast is put together by André Valle, Max Kaplun and Rebecca West, and made possible thanks to our sponsors Unbounce and ReadyMag. Our host and moderator is Alex Nemeroff, partner and design lead at Dynamo.
