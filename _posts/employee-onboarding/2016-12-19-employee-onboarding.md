Trello is our primary tool used for onboarding new hires. Included in it would be their checklist of things to complete ‘before your first day’, their agenda ‘on your first day/week’.

## Before Your First Day – Email 
Before an employee’s first day at Dynamo, we like to send them a little note like this:
Hey, it's approaching your first day here at Dynamo, and we could not be happier to have you. This Trello board is the central piece of your first week at our agency. It will give you a roadmap of the many little things you will have to do to get acquainted with our culture, life and work style.

## Housekeeping
Included in this email, we also like to ask people to do the following, so we are ready to hit the ground running on their first day:

Provide a void cheque/direct deposit information
Read through Dynamo’s core values
Complete contracts and sign forms
Sign up for Bamboo

## Who’s Who
So an employee can get a sneak peek into the who’s who at Dynamo, each team member provides a photo and personalized message to the new hire. 


## The first week
We provide a helpful checklist of the following items: 
* Meet your mentor
* Tour the office
* Tour the neighborhood
* Meet the team
* Set up your computer
* Set up Bamboo
* Write your bio for the team page on our website
* Learn how to use our coffee machine

## After your first week
We’ll set up a series of check-ins to see how things are going:
* First Week Review
* 30-Day Review
* 60-Day Review
* 90-Day Review

This should serve as guidance for the new hire throughout their first few weeks at Dynamo. It is important to assure that the new hire has all the tools needed to set them up for success.
