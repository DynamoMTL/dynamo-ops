Every new hire at Dynamo is assigned a mentor to help them learn the ropes while getting settled in at Dynamo. 

<!-- more -->

Here’s what we ask the mentor to prepare for a new employee in advance of their first day: 

* Send Welcome Email (see Welcome Letter)

* Set up employee on Bamboo, Email, Know Your Company, Trello, Basecamp and Slack

* Set up Onboarding Trello board

* Gather workspace materials (see Workspace)

* Schedule the One Week, 30-Day, 60-Day and 90-Day reviews. 

Additionally, when you set up the Onboarding Trello board, you’ll also be responsible for following up the welcome email in Trello: 

You should have received an email with all the tools you must subscribe to, in order to get set up for your everyday work. Here's a checklist that echoes the email, and that you should go through at first. If you are not sure about something, don't hesitate to ask your mentor.

Making sure our new colleague feels right at home is our top priority. We want to show that we are prepared to help and support them throughout their time here at Dynamo, and this begins the moment they accept the job offer.
