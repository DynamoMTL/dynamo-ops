Hey (insert new teammate’s name),

On behalf of the whole team here at Dynamo, I am super pumped that you're joining our team on (insert start day)! I hope you enjoy these few final life-before-Dynamo days because life, as you know it, is about to get a serious boost of awesome.

I want to brief you on a few tidbits before (insert start day) so that you can start with stride. I don't intend to fill your final days with "homework", but rather a few insights, bits of information and a general Hello!

First of all, I've ordered a MacBook for you here, so no need to bring your own. However if, like me, you have a personal laptop that you see as a security blanket, then by all means bring it too... 

I'd like for you to take a moment to check out 3 applications we use for Operations here that will help get you situated and prep you for Day One in more detail:

1. **Trello:** Please sign up / log into Trello by clicking on **[this lin**k](https://trello.com/invite/b/ZxFEyZDL/f862181836a874a33112c234871d6cb0/onboarding-sam) to gain access to our Onboarding: (insert new teammate’s name) board (insert link to trello board). Please have a look at the "Before First Day" list to see what's happening before your first day. Also, please have a look at "On First Day / Week" list to see what the plan is for your first day and week. There's a few cards that you are expected to participate in. 

2. **Bamboo**: You should have received an email to your new **(insert new godynamo email)** email account granting access to BambooHR, our HR repository: [https://dynamo.bamboohr.com/](https://dynamo.bamboohr.com/). Please log in there and add/edit any pertinent information that you would like.

3. **Know Your Company**: You should have also received an email to your **(insert new godynamo email)**  email account from Know Your Company, an application we use to help us all get to know one another, share ideas, and generally provide an outlet for sharing. Please take a sec to use it to intro yourself to everyone.

On (insert start day), I'd invite you to arrive at around 10:00 or so. (Insert specific information regarding first day, who should they will be meeting).

And last but not least, please bring a void cheque and/or the necessary banking info for our bookkeeper, to set you up on payroll.

Thanks so much and feel free to email me back with any questions.

Otherwise, see you on (insert start day),

(insert mentors name)
