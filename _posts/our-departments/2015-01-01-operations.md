What is the Operations department within Dynamo? It is made up of the Director of Operations, the Office Manager, and a morphing group of team members who form various committees & task forces aiming to improve the operations of Dynamo throughout the year. <!-- more --> We expect anyone working within the confines of “Operations” to have two main goals in mind when going about their work: 1) Constantly improve the way in which Dynamo operates and 2) Constantly improve client happiness, where “client” = Dynamo. 

To the first point, the Operations department is in a constant state of change with regards to optimizing how we work, how we get things done and how we measure our effectiveness. We evaluate financials, lag indicators, leading indicators, quality of products, and budget/timing accuracies. Our aim is to constantly iterate over each of these areas as we learn more, grow more and experiment. 

To the second point, as our Human Resources department falls under the Director of Operations, we are always aiming for team happiness. Dynamo is our client as far as we are concerned and we strive, at every possible opportunity within reason, to ensure client happiness. Happiness begets happiness and we strongly believe in the positive power of happiness here at Dynamo. It’s tough to measure on its own which is why point #1 above is as equally important. If we’re showing constant improvement on the former, then the latter will undoubtedly improve as well.
