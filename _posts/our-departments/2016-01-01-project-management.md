## Department: Project Management

Here's what our PMs do,a dn do well!

1. Finish Projects on Time
Every PM wants to be on time. Of course we can’t control every factor that will make our projects late, but if we make it a goal to get ahead of those delays, we wrap up projects on time.

2. Control Budget and Scope
Another core project management value. And, of course, another tough one to control. We make it our goal to have a better understanding of budget, scope, AND the impacts that outside factors could have on it, so that we tune ourself in to the right details to stay on top of scope creep issues.

3. Be a Good Communicator
It’s been said time and time again that communication is critical to the PM role. Clear communication  makes project kickoffs smoother, status reports easier to digest, scrum meetings short and actionable, internal communications frequent and valuable, and so on. 

4. Ensure Quality
We are a quality check on our projects. Since we are truly invested in our projects, we won’t let something faulty go out the door. Sure, it happens sometimes, but since we're committed to ensuring quality, we also ensure that our clients, stakeholders, and teams are happy with the work that’s being produced.


5. Be Strategic
As a Dynamo PM, we get out of that To-do List mentality. It’s not just about checking tasks off a list—it’s about doing what’s right for a project given the path it (or its team and stakeholders) are taking. We focus on the goals of the project and how we—as a team—can better serve that goal through the project. Sometimes that means we re-think process and deliverables, sometimes it won’t. Either way, our strategic input gets us to look at our projects through a different lens: one that will show long-term impacts and decisions rather than the short-term tasks.

6. Understand Financial Impacts
It’s easy to be the PM and say “we have to meet the budget because it’s what was scoped and is in our contract,” but it is far more meaningful to be able to say, “If we go over budget, it will have X, Y, Z impacts on our business and our relationships with our partners and clients.” That’s right—think about your project as a micro piece of the bigger business. How will our project(s) impact larger pieces of business in your organization and how can we keep it in tact to help meet company-wide goals? 

7. Follow Our Industry
If we want to make a bigger impact on the success of our projects, we have to understand what’s happening in our industry. We make it our goal to connect to our industry in ways that will allow us to learn and advance: read trade publications, follow blogs, twitter accounts, and more. 

8. Be Adaptable
Related to #6 and $7, we have to be acutely aware of our surroundings. If we have an eye on our industry and our organization, we’ll be able to sense when things are changing. We use that information to adapt practices as an individual, or on our projects. Project managers find the most success when they adapt to changes (and, yes, control them within reason), so when we see a change coming, we make it an opportunity to pivot toward success.
