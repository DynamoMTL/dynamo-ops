We have been sending out a newsletter on a semi-regular basis since November 2014, using Mailchimp to manage subscribers and campaigns. The newsletter is signed "Alex from Dynamo" and replies go to Alex’s email.

Typically, content blocks will fall into the following categories:

**Project launch or update**

Showcasing a recent project launch or project update.</td>

**Event recap**

A recap of an event we have attended recently (workshop or conference) whether locally or internationally.

**Dynamic/MTL**

Announcements regarding upcoming Dynamic/MTL or DynamicLabs events, or recap videos from previous events.
 
 **Letter from a founder**

More of a personal letter to subscribers from a Founder, e.g. about a company retreat or other company milestone.

**Client in the news**

Recap / links to client media coverage.

**Blog post**

Summary of a recent blog post with link to read complete article on the blog.
    
**Community Update**

Announcement / opinion on community events or news, such as a Ladies Learning Code event, or the On the grid guide.


## Frequency

We have published on a monthly basis since November 2015, although now seem to be transitioning to a less frequent schedule, every six or eight weeks.

## How can we improve?

* New consistent visual approach

*  More "letter" style campaigns

*  Distinction between campaigns from Alex and campaigns from Rebecca?

*  More "round-up" style content e.g. Dynamo as industry leaders, pointing readers to what we find relevant / important, such as:

    * Industry news

    *  What we’re reading

    *  What events are on our radar
