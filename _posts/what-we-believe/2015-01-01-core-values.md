## We care for each other —  our clients, our partners, our team.

Both as a company and as individuals, we take care of each other. By seeking out the best projects, an advantageous healthcare program, a business cell phone plan, catered lunches, yoga and gym lessons, a yearly learning allocation budget, the freedom to work remotely, and using time tracking wisely –  it’s clear that the team as a whole make up the voice and passion of this company.

## We pursue both specialization and versatility

At Dynamo, we always hire and develop the best new talent. We embrace the fact that we are experts in our field, and aim to offer the highest value to our clients and partners. Through our yearly learning allocation program we encourage every team member to stay updated on industry developments through continued training and development in their area of expertise as well as across a broad spectrum of competencies. Our team is recognized not only locally, but also internationally, for our innovative projects and our contributions to our respective fields.

## We look ahead

Our team craves knowledge. We love learning about new technologies and are excited about finding opportunities to use them. We also empower one another to share these findings with our peers, as we pride ourselves on a rich pairing and mentoring culture. We strive to constantly employ new knowledge to existing work so that we can lay solid groundwork for the future.

## We are pragmatic — focused on solving the problem

At Dynamo, we embrace and welcome the change that is intrinsic to our industry. We crave challenges and obstacles and "change" often creates some. Through it all, we never lose sight of the end goal, remain pragmatic to a fault and solve problems like it's going out of style.

## We lift each other up

When the days are smooth, and the projects run like soft butter, it's easy to breathe softly and be inspiring to those around you, to lift each other up. It's amidst the stressful moments, the chaotic times and the stresses of agency life that our ability to lift each other up really shines. We strive to make every interaction a positive one, no matter the circumstance.

## We take ownership of the things we touch

We care about our work. In fact, we love it. It’s no surprise that we feel a sense of pride and investment in every project that leaves the studio. From the very beginning, we’ve perceived our clients as our partners. We know that our work will have a direct impact on the success of their business, and we love that responsibility. We challenge ourselves to be our very best and to restrain from feeling ownership over what we deliver.
