## Become Experts

At Dynamo, we always hire and develop the best new talent. We embrace the fact that we are experts in our field, and aim to offer the highest value to our clients and partners. Through our yearly learning allocation program we encourage every team member to stay updated on industry developments through continued training and development. Our team is recognized not only locally, but also internationally, for our innovative projects and our contributions to our respective fields.

## Make Others Better

Our team craves knowledge. We love learning about new technologies and are excited about finding opportunities to use them. We also empower one another to share these findings with our peers, as we pride ourselves on a rich pairing and mentoring culture.

## Care About Our Work

We care about our work. In fact, we love it. It’s no surprise that we feel a sense of pride and investment in every project that leaves the studio. From the very beginning, we’ve perceived our clients as our partners. We know that our work will have a direct impact on the success of their business, and we love that responsibility. We challenge ourselves to be our very best and to restrain from feeling ownership over what we deliver.

## Embrace Change

At Dynamo, we embrace and welcome the change that is intrinsic to our industry. We crave challenges and obstacles and "change" often creates some. The company has seen many big changes in the last years and as only stood taller and proven to thrive from it.

## Reciprocal Caring

Both as a company and as individuals, we take care of each other. By seeking out the best projects, an advantageous healthcare program, a business cell phone plan, catered lunches, yoga and gym lessons, a yearly learning allocation budget, the freedom to work remotely, and abolishing time tracking –  it’s clear that the team as a whole make up the voice and passion of this company.
