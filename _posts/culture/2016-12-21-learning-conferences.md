Dynamo encourages employees to grow their skillset and expertise by offering an annual education budget. Dynamo grants CAD $1000 annually to each team member to use over the calendar year. This budget does not 'roll over' to the following year.  

<!-- more -->

Feel free to use your budget on books, podcasts, networking, subscriptions, online or in-person courses, workshops, conferences, or anything else you see fit (just run it past our Operations team real quick before purchase).

These budgets are often used to attend conferences. In return, we ask that you create a Lunch & Learn presentation or a blog post to share what you learned at the event with the rest of the team. This must be completed within two weeks of the event. Some of the conferences we have attended include An Event Apart, OFFFF, JSConf, The Future of Web Design, Smashing Conf, and many more. 

If you are interested in attending a conference, send Corey and Sam an email listing your expenses that are within the learning budget. These expenses can include conference ticket, flight, hotel or Airbnb costs.
