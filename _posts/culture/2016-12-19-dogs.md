The Dynamo doors are open to all furry friends. We have a few rules to follow:

<!-- more -->

* Dogs are not allowed in the carpeted conference rooms

* Every second Thursday, dogs are not allowed on the third floor out of respect for the bookkeeper; they are, however, permitted on the second floor, but the owners should consider working from home that day

* Do not feed the office pups anything that hasn’t been approved by their owner

* If you bring your dog to work, please take full responsibility for your pup while they’re visiting the office

* Dogs must respect the work environment, especially when it comes to noise levels, approachability and cleanliness

* Visiting dogs must also be friendly around other dogs 

* During the winter or rainy days, please wipe your dog’s paws before entering the work area

In the cabinet at the front of the office, you will find some goodies for your pup, including plastic bags, rags and toys. Feel free to grab what you need.
