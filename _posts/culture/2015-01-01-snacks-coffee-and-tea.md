## Snacks
Light snacks are provided, and you will find an array of nuts, fruit and other treats around the kitchen. If you have any suggestions, don’t hesitate to let Sam know. 


## Coffee & Tea
Coffee is also provided by Dynamo, and though few among us will cop to it: we’re coffee snobs. Luckily, our supply is delivered weekly our neighborhood roastery and cafe, Dispatch. We have a filter coffee machine *and *an espresso machine (you’ll receive a tutorial on both on your first day)!

Tea is ordered on a monthly basis from David’s Tea. Don’t hesitate to let Sam know if you have a favourite flavour or we’re out of stock.
