Dynamo provides the team with a healthy, locally and sustainably sourced meal three times per  week from Provisions1268. 

<!-- more -->

Meals are provided Tuesdays through Thursdays, and 50% of the cost is covered by Dynamo (to learn more about this, check out the Subsidized Lunch Plan). Each week, you’ll receive two options for meals and two options for side-dishes. One option caters to a vegetarian/pescatarian diet, and the other appeals to the more carnivorous among us. These options must be selected two weeks prior to delivery, and cannot be changed at the last minute. On Thursdays, delicious desserts are provided.

To ensure that we keep the team and the planet happy, here are a few guidelines to keep in mind:

* Please wash and recycle/compost used containers (as noted on container)

* Please cross off your meals on the daily list to ensure that everyone collects the appropriate meal

* If your lunch is "up for grabs" please let the team know on the #lunchtime Slack channel

* We do not take other’s meals if they are not there, unless otherwise noted. 

* Whatever is left in the fridge as of 4:00PM on Friday, is free for all. 

Bon appetit!
