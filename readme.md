### Running the server

To run the project after checkout:
- `bundle install`
- `npm install`
- `bower install`
- `bundle exec gulp serve`

To run an already checked out project:
- `bundle exec gulp serve`

You are welcome.

### Creating a post

Jekyll requires that the posts be named in the following format `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`. So for example, `2011-12-31-new-years-eve-is-awesome.md`. This however does not mean that the URL will reflect that but it really needs to be called as such to be picked up buy Jekyll as being a post.
