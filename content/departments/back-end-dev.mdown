## Department's summary, role, and philosophy
The role of the department should be there as a pure way to clarify or solidify people's needs while working for/at Dynamo. Whatever this may entail! The philosophy of the department should reflect the use: Transparency and openness.

##Department's process and workflow (i.e. inception, weekly iterations, etc.)
Due to the complexity and near never endingness of the workflow's involved (for both us and everyone affected by our ideas), we should spend some time figuring out ways to measure potential changes, requirements and then act on the accrued data. This is a little wishy-washy but definitely can be hammered out with more than one smart mind.

##Department's tools / framework / techniques - must know (i.e. CSS);
Wiki knowledge (editing in markdown)

##Department's tools / framework / techniques - nice to have;
Ruby
CoffeeScript
SCSS

##Department's resources (To Learn, Stay in Loop, etc);
Wiki. Whatever this may be, but a good way to collaborate and have a great way to structure operations based knowledge

##Department's flagship project (one or two)
- Wiki or multiple wiki's/repositories of knowledge that are easily searchable and everyone in the company has access to.
- Some kind of recommendation repository where anyone in the company can anonymously recommend a way to modify/better the way we are doing things internally.

##Department's general tools (i.e. Basecamp)
Basecamp during the original build process and move to more of the knowledge/wiki style repository that lives and grows much more organically and "flowy" over Basecamp's thread based workflow.
